# odin-landing-page

This project is a foundational corse from The Odin Project

the gal is to create a landing page from the criterial set in the
criterial directory.

Inside are two pictures, one for how the finished project should look,
another with the font type, size, color and background colors of the project should look like
from my understanding these parameters are subjective but the full design should mirror the 
one given from a format perspective.

I will try to document all code i create so that i can easily be followed.
