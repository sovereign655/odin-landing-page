# odin-landing-page

This project is a foundational course from The Odin Project

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

the gal is to create a landing page from the criterial set in the
criterial directory.

Inside are two pictures, one for how the finished project should look,
another with the font type, size, color and background colors of the project should look like
from my understanding these parameters are subjective but the full design should mirror the 
one given from a format perspective.

I will try to document all code i create so that i can easily be followed.

sites that i used to help with the design:
https://copy-paste-css.com/box-shadows to add a hover function the buttons
https://flexbox.malven.co/ a Flexbox Cheatsheet for when i forget a reference
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.php to help understand the :hover function
